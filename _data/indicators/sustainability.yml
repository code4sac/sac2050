  description: "Particulate matter are tiny bits of metals, soot, soil and dust found in the air. High levels can worsen heart and lung diseases (especially in the elderly and the very young). The California standard is 12 mpcm, which is the 'maximum amount of pollutant that can be present in outdoor air without harming human health.' The California Air Resources Board tracks two sizes: up to 10 microns (PM10) and 2.5 microns (PM2.5). This chart is yearly averages of PM2.5."
